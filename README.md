# Condor

## Why?
* TweetDeck Enhancer retrieves assets from the owner's website, and collects analytics. This poses a privacy risk, and the owner has shown no interest in resolving it.
* (To do:) TweetDeck Enhancer is *huge*. 16k lines. It takes the original TweetDeck stylesheets `app-light.css` and `app-dark.css` and works from there, rather than overriding TweetDeck's CSS as a userstyle would (or using a preprocessor like sass).
* TweetDeck Enhancer has, in the past, changed majorly every few months or so. I just want something that works.
